<h2> <u>Who are we? </u> </h2>
<p>Basically, we are <b>students from different schools</b>, gathered to provide other students from <span> <u> inside AND outside </u> </span> the university,
      with services that they need and which we also happen to excel at. We have members from Design and Media, Ethical Hacking, Computer Science, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.
    <br> we help in building module-based projects for other students and we also built a graduation project for a group of member from outside our university.
